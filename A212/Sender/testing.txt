From application dev’s view, the network architecture is fixed and provides specific set of services to applications
Application architecture: designed by application dev and dictates how the application is structured over various end systems
Two paradigms used in modern network applications:
Client-server architecture
Peer to peer (P2P) architecture
Client-server architecture: there’s an always-on host, called the server, which services requests from other hosts, clients
Some examples include the Web, FTP, Telnet, and email
Often, single-server host is incapable of keeping up with all client requests
For this reason, a data center (houses a large number of hosts) is often used to create a powerful virtual server
